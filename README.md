# Browser-based demo for the *slendr* [ProbGen 2022 poster](https://probgen22.github.io/abstracts/index.html#P40)

You can open a browser-based RStudio session and run the examples from our poster directly in your web browser (no installation needed!). Simply click on this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/probgen2022/main?urlpath=rstudio)

In case the Binder cloud instance appears to be having issues, please be patient. After all, it uses freely available computing resources that are shared among many different projects.

The Binder cloud server can sometimes take a minute to load up. Sometimes it even crashes completely. If that happens, try reloading the page—this will restart the Binder session.

## Further information
