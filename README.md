# *slendr*: browser-based demo for ProbGen 2022

You can open a browser-based RStudio session and run the examples from our poster directly in your web browser (no installation needed!). Simply click on this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bodkan/probgen2022/HEAD)

In case the Binder cloud instance appears to be having issues, please be patient. After all, it uses freely available computing resources that are shared among many different projects.

The Binder cloud server can sometimes take a minute to load up. Sometimes it even crashes completely. If that happens, try reloading the page - this will restart the Binder session.

## Further information

-   [Website](https://www.slendr.net/) of the *slendr* project contains lots of documentation and tutorials.
-   The code lives on [GitHub](https://github.com/bodkan/slendr/).
-   We now have a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.20.485041v1)! It's currently the best source of information about *slendr*â€”its design, architecture, features, and future plans.
-   I will be posting updates to the project on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dr_bodkan).
